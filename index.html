                <p>
                    I'm a graduate student in mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the US.
                    Most of the math I do has a geometrical or topological flavor to it.
                    That's because I like pictures.

                    The goal of this project was to visualize good 2-dimensional orbifolds whose universal cover is the plane.
                    We did this directly in the web browser, and the result can be found <a href="orbifolds/">here</a> (recent webbrowser required; in my experience Chrome works best).

                <h2>Master's thesis</h2>
                <p>
                    As part of my master's degree at the University of Leuven (Belgium),
                    I wrote a thesis called <em>Moduli Spaces of Flat Connections</em>.
                    You can download it as <a href="docs/thesis.pdf">a pdf-document</a>.<br />
                    There is also a condensed version available of the slideshow I used for
                    my thesis defense. <a href="docs/thesis-defense-print.pdf">This pdf-document</a>
                    is the original slideshow without animation and with only one overview slide.

                <h2>Visualizing Frenet-Serret</h2>
                <p>
                    I once made a visualization of the Frenet-Serret frame of a curve
                    in differential geometry. You can download it as a video <a href="docs/frenet.mp4">here</a>.<br />
                    The video shows a space curve in red (twice continuously differentiable).
                    An airplane follows the curve at unit speed, orienting itself according to the Frenet frame. The nose points along the tangent and the 'up' direction of the plane points along the normal, so that the right wing points along the binormal. The curvature can then be interpreted as the pitch of the plane, and the torsion as rolling.
                    Someday I should add curvature and torsion to the animation.<br />
                    The animation was made in Blender. Thanks go to Pieter Segaert for rendering some of the frames on his computer.

                    In March of 2013, I taught a session on inequalities to several excellent
                    participants of the Flemish Mathematical Olympiad, as preparation for the
                    International Mathematical Olympiad. The notes I wrote up are available as
                    <a href="docs/ongelijkheden.pdf">a pdf-document</a>. They are in Dutch.

                    How many strings of six letters contain no letter more than twice?
                    The answer is provided <a href="count-words.html">here</a> in Dutch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the summer of 2012 I started a project called <em>Egel</em> (Dutch for <em>hedgehog</em>; no reason)
                    to help students pass the Belgian entrance exam for medical school.
                    The project is no longer online, but I've tried to make a usable offline version.
                    You can now find the project <a href="docs/egel.zip">here</a>, packed as a zip file.
                    Unzip it, and open index.html in your web browser.
                    Almost everything should work without problems.
                    Oh, by the way, it's in Dutch.
